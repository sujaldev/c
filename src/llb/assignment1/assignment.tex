    \section*{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
    The Internet is one of mankind's greatest achievements and an open Internet, free of censorship and control by any
    authority, is crucial to avoid a dystopian future, but ever since it's inception, government authorities have
    employed various tactics to censor the information published via the World Wide Web.\ This report details the
    state of fundamental rights as they exist in the digital landscape of India and how the Indian government has often
    violated these rights to censor the Internet and use it as a tool for mass-surveillance.\ Such acts go against
    constitutional values as envisioned by the authors of the Indian Constitution, and people in relevant fields of
    studies should feel responsible to oppose the continued decline of the open Internet, and they should push for
    technical solutions that uphold constitutional values.

    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

    The Indian Constitution provides six fundamental rights to all citizens of India, one of which is the right to
    freedom.\ According to article 19(1)(a):
    \begin{quote}
        \singlespacing
        (1)
        All citizens shall have the right---\\
        \vspace*{-15pt}
        \begin{enumerate}
        (a)
            to freedom of speech and expression;\\
            \ldots
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{quote}
    citizens of India are provided a fundamental right to express their views relating to any matter.\ Due to this
    fundamental right, citizens are allowed to offer criticism to the state, in fact, without criticism the government
    loses accountability, and yet, various articles offering such criticism published on the web often has the
    possibility of landing the author in jail.
    \\
    According to the Supreme Court of India's ruling in the
    \textit{Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) \& Another. vs. Union Of India \& Others} case, the right to privacy is
    protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the
    freedoms guaranteed by Part \Romannum{3} of the Constitution.
    \\
    These fundamental rights are guaranteed for every citizen of India, but in reality, the Indian government itself has
    a history of openly violating these rights.\ The following sections describe how the Indian government tackles
    various issues relating to maintaining fundament rights on the Internet.

    \section{Censorship}\label{sec:censorship}

    Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are often ordered by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to block a large
    number of websites without any prior warnings or even without stating any reasons as to why a particular site was
    added to the blocklist.\ This blocklist may include websites which distribute any content unfavourable to the
    government, this violates the fundament right of speech and expression.\ The lack of transparency by the government
    on what websites are added to the blocklist is a violation of right to information and goes against the spirit of
    democracy, and often leads to legitimate websites being blocked.\ I have personally experienced two such instances;
    the content delivery network of a major Microsoft owned source-code hosting website, GitHub, was blocked for months
    by major ISPs such as Airtel, Jio, ACT Fibernet and many more.\ The website for the free and open source software
    VLC was also blocked under orders from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.\ Moreover, the
    technical implementation of this blocklist inherently implies the violation of right to privacy as one can not block
    a website without first knowing what websites a person is visiting in the first place.\ Till now, ISPs chose to
    implement these orders by returning a bogus Internet address when a user requested the location of a blocked
    website from their servers, this implementation could be easily bypassed by simply directing encrypted queries to a
    server outside the jurisdiction of the Indian government, but now, large ISPs like Airtel and Jio have found more
    successful methods to implement the blocklist, they exploit an inherent flaw in the encryption protocol used on the
    web (TLS), wherein, the ISP can not know what contents on a website a user is accessing, but it can figure out what
    website they're accessing as that information is sent out in plain-text during the initial handshake between the
    server and the client.
