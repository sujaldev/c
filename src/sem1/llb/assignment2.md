# Assignment 2 (Unit 3 & 4)

<h4>Q1) Explain Presidential and parliamentary forms of government. Should India adopt Presidential form of government
instead of Parliamentary form of government? Give arguments in support and against your opinion.</h4>

Presidential and parliamentary forms of government are both a form of democracy differing in how the separation of power
is implemented in each system.

In a parliamentary form of government:

1. The executive is accountable to the legislature (the parliament), and the parliament can exercise control over the
   executive.
2. The head of the government and the head of the state are separate entities, the former holds real power while the
   latter is a ceremonial position with limited powers.
3. The executive requires parliamentary approval for various decisions.
4. The parliament can remove the cabinet (executive) with a vote of no confidence.

In a presidential form of government:

1. The executive branch is separate from the legislative branch and is not accountable to the legislative branch.
2. The head of the government is also the head of the state.
3. Unlike in a parliamentary system, the head of the government cannot be removed by the legislative branch except in
   extraordinary cases.

India has implemented a parliamentary form of government, but the pros and cons of a presidential system are still worth
considering. The benefits of a presidential system are:

1. In a presidential system, the president can appoint experts in their respective fields to head various departments
   and ministries without requiring them to be members of the legislature.
2. A presidential system is considered more stable than a parliamentary system as the tenure of the President is fixed
   and not subject to a vote of no-confidence. This reduces pressure from the decision-making process as there is no
   risk of a sudden collapse of the government.

The disadvantages of a presidential system are:

1. Unlike in a parliamentary system, the executive is not responsible to the legislature in a presidential system which
   can potentially lead to a transition to an authoritarian form of government.
2. While a presidential form of government offers stability, it also implies rigidity. Compared to a parliamentary
   system, it is rather difficult to remove the President from power if the citizens no longer have confidence in their
   elected President.
3. Since the executive and legislative branch are separate, disagreements between them may lead to inefficiency and
   wastage of time.
4. The transition would be a monumental task requiring enormous resources.

<h4>Q2) What is the method of appointment of Supreme Court judges in India? Do you think India should move from current
collegium system for appointment of judges to a new more transparent and accountable method? Suggest alternative methods
and give advantages and disadvantages for it.</h4>

India uses a collegium system to appoint judges in the Supreme Court, in this system the collegium, which consists of
the Chief Justice of India and four senior most judges of the supreme court, set forth a recommendation list to the
President of India, who then selects from this list to appoint judges.

The collegium system has faced various criticisms such as:

1. The collegium system lacks transparency as judges are appointed by a few judges in complete secrecy, this makes the
   process for the appointment of judges vulnerable to issues such as nepotism/favouritism.
2. The decisions made by this process are not held accountable by any administrative body.

Due to such issues with the collegium system I think transitioning to a more transparent and accountable method would be
in the best interest of the nation.

In 2014, another system called the National Judicial Appointments System (NJAC) was proposed as a replacement for the
collegium system. NJAC would have consisted of the Chief Justice of India, two senior supreme court judges, the Union
Minister of Law and Justice, two eminent persons selected by Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister of India and the
head of the opposition in Lok Sabha. The advantages of NJAC were:

1. It would've provided more transparency and accountability.
2. It integrates the judiciary with the executive and makes it inclusive.

The disadvantages of NJAC were:

1. The Indian Constitution guarantees an independent judiciary system, NJAC would have violated this by including the
   executive in the process of appointment of judges.
