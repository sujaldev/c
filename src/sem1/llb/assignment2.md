<h4>Q1) Explain Presidential and parliamentary forms of government. Should India adopt Presidential form of government
instead of Parliamentary form of government? Give arguments in support and against your opinion.</h4>

Presidential and parliamentary forms of government are both a form of democracy differing in how the separation of power
is implemented in each system.

In a parliamentary form of government:

1. The executive is accountable to the legislature (the parliament), and the parliament can exercise control over the
   executive.
2. The head of the government and the head of the state are separate entities, the former holds real power while the
   latter is a ceremonial position with limited powers.
3. The executive requires parliamentary approval for various decisions.
4. The parliament can remove the cabinet (executive) with a vote of no confidence.

In a presidential form of government:

1. The executive branch is separate from the legislative branch and is not accountable to the legislative branch.
2. The head of the government is also the head of the state.
3. Unlike in a parliamentary system, the head of the government cannot be removed by the legislative branch except in
   extraordinary cases.

India has implemented a parliamentary form of government, but the pros and cons of a presidential system are still worth
considering. The benefits of a presidential system are:

1. In a presidential system, the president can appoint experts in their respective fields to head various departments
   and ministries without them being a member of the legislature.
2. A presidential system is considered more stable than a parliamentary system as the tenure of the President is fixed
   and not subject to a vote of no-confidence. This reduces pressure from the decision-making process as there is no
   risk of a sudden collapse of the government.

The disadvantages of a presidential system are:

1. Unlike in a parliamentary system, the executive is not responsible to the legislature in a presidential system which
   can potentially lead to a transition to an authoritarian form of government.
2. While a presidential form of government offers stability, it also implies rigidity. Compared to a parliamentary
   system, it is rather difficult to remove the President from power if the citizens no longer have confidence in their
   elected President.
3. Since the executive and legislative branch are separate, it can lead to inefficiency and wastage of time if both the
   branches do not agree upon a decision.
4. The transition would be a monumental task requiring enormous resources.
