            The Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI-2) nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania experienced a partial meltdown on
            March 28, 1979 which caused an \alert{increase in radiation level and an explosion within the building},
            there were no casualties.\ The reactor was brought under control after 13.5 hours.
        \end{minipage}

        Here's a breakdown of what happened:\\[10pt]
        \begin{itemize}
            \small
            \item A malfunction in the demineralizer led to the shutdown of water pumps feeding the reactor core.
            \item Reactor pressure rose, triggering safety measures to insert control rods and stop the fission process.
            \item A pressure relief valve remained open, preventing proper cooling of the reactor core.
            \item Water loss from the core and overheating caused fuel rod damage.
            \item A chemical reaction between steam and reactor components produced hydrogen gas.
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{Chernobyl Disaster (\mathbf{1986})}\\[5pt]

        \begin{center}
            \begin{figure}
                \label{fig:chernobyl}

            \end{figure}
        \end{center}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The Chernobyl plant used RBMK reactors, with a graphite water cooling system, known for safety
            vulnerabilities.
            \item A turbine generator test was scheduled during maintenance, requiring a power reduction to 700 MW.
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Ignoring Safety Measures:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Operators disconnected the emergency cooling system.
                \item The test was conducted at an abnormally low power level (200 MW).
                \item Emergency signals and automatic shutdowns were deliberately blocked.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Operator Error and Escalation}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Operators further compromised safety by raising control rods to increase power, causing a rise
                in reactor temperature and fission rate.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Catastrophic Outcome}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The reactor core melted, leading to a fire and the release of radioactive materials across the
                USSR and Europe.
                \item Evacuation of nearby residents was delayed for hours after the explosion.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Casualties and Impact}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Over 30 plant workers died, with 200 suffering burns.
                \item Long-term health effects resulted in an estimated 8,000 deaths.
                \item Agricultural production was significantly impacted by radioactive contamination for years.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \\[5pt]
        \textbf{Safety Lessons from TMI and Chernobyl}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Stronger containment structures to prevent radiation leaks after explosions.
            \item If power increases during critical tests, like at Chernobyl, should be rejected or halted entirely
            with safety systems reactivate
            \item Continuous monitoring of critical components is essential for early detection of issues.
            \item Establish comprehensive emergency plans.
            \item Prompt notification of superiors and timely evacuation of nearby residents (both TMI and Chernobyl).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}[t,allowframebreaks]{Collegiality and Loyalty}
        \textbf{Collegiality} is about creating a supportive environment where colleagues:\\[5pt]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \alert{Respect} each other's ideas and contributions.
            \item Share a \alert{commitment} to moral principles and the organization's goals.
            \item Develop a sense of \alert{connectedness}.
        \end{itemize}
        \\[10pt]
        \textbf{Loyalty} has two sides:\\[5pt]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \underline{Agency Loyalty} is about fulfilling your contractual obligations.\ You complete assigned
            tasks and
            cooperate with others.
            \item \underline{Attitude Loyalty} It's about feeling a sense of belonging and wanting to contribute
            positively.\ This loyalty is ideal when the organization works for good.\ However, it shouldn't extend to
            unethical practices.
        \end{itemize}

        \framebreak

        \textbf{Respect for authority} ensures decisions translate to action.\ It comes in two forms:\\[5pt]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \underline{Institutional Authority} is the official power given to managers (like Line Managers) to
            allocate resources, make decisions, and guide their teams towards achieving goals.
            \item \underline{Expert Authority} relies on specialized knowledge.\ Experts (consultants, advisors) use
            their expertise to advise and guide others, not through official power, but through their credibility and
            proven skills.
